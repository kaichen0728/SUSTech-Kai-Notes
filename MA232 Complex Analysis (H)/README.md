# MA232 Complex Analysis (H) (Spring 2025)

### by Prof. [Ilya Kossovskiy](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/c/kossovskiyilya)

A really hard and confusing course. Not like any ordinary complex analysis course, it has a different structure and different focus. It also contains many other staff that usually not exist in undergraduate complex analysis courses.

I did well through the semester but did very very bad in the final exam. The rule is: 3 hours, get as many points as you can and the full mark is 100. I felt badly trained in this course and cannot imagine many things in my mind. Also, the intuition in complex analysis is totally different from real analysis. I haven't get the right intuition at the end of the semester. I also picked up too many courses this semester, so I didn't have enough time to adjust my intuition and consider more about how theorems works and how they could work with each other.

It's undoubtedly a great lesson. I'll try my best in analysis and make myself more focused.
