Log about loading and saving game part;

1. while newing a user, we will create 15 files recording each level for the user.
    1.1 we have a special user called user0001, whose file will never be used unless when we want tot refer to the initial frame by reading the file.
        Rmk: this is a simple backup user.
    1.2 we have the recording like : 0 / 0 / new / {...}, the first integer records te steps now, the second records the time and 'new' means new game.
    1.3 Warning: it's important to have a status representative, which will be used in the loading part for checking whether the user has played before.
2. while saving files,
    2.1 the saving method could only be used during the playing process (for victory and failure, we need to reset the status part).
