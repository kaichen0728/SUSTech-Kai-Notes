# SUSTech-Notes

This is where I stored my study notes and materials at Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech). I'll upload a whole semester's material after each semester's final week, usually in one or two weeks.

I started this repository in 2026. Courses I took before will be updated around July to August this year.

As a public repository, it guarantees that all the resources could be used safely under the lisence's protection.
