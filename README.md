# SUSTech-Notes
This is where I stored my Mathematics learning notes at Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech).

Founded in 2010, SUSTech is the representative of new era's innovative research universities in China. The Mathematical department here offers first-class courses for students, and I'm truly grateful for the department and university.

I hope this repository can recorde my learning patterns in SUSTech and help those who wish to get a glance of the courses offered in SUSTech or dive into the courses themselves.
