# SUSTech-Notes

This is where I stored my Mathematics learning notes and materials at Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech). I'll upload a whole semester's material after each semester's final week, usually in one or two weeks.

I started this repository in 2026. Courses I took before will be updated around July to August 2026.
