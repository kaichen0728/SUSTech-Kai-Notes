I took this course as a general-education-level course in Shenzhen University(Lihu Campus) in Spring 2025 as an "exchange student"(跨校课程互选计划).

It's a two-credit simple course in economics, specializing in social issues, not requiring acdemic background in economics. You could see a branch of students who are really concerned about the society and many ideas poped up.
