# MA340 Fourier Analysis Seminar (Spring 2025)

### with Prof. Pedro A. S. Salomão

This is the second seminar I took in SUSTech. It should have been a real course staff at the very beginning. But due to many reasons, it became a seminar.

We base on Stein's *'Princeton Lecture In Analysis I: Fourier Analysis'*

Listed above is a tex file of a small talk I gave on the seminar.
