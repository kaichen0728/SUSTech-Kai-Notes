# MA219 Abstract Algebra (H) (Fall 2024)

### by Prof. [Caiheng Li](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/c/licaiheng)

A rush course, covering groups (including group homomorphisms, group actions, Sylow Theorems, semi-product), rings (ring homomorphisms, factorization, Chinese Reminder Theorem, UFD, PID, ED), fields (field extensions, Galois groups, Galois Theorem).

Assigned textbook is *Abstact Algebra by Chunlai Zhao & Mingyao Xu, Peking University Press*. I highly recommend *David S. Dummit's Abstract Algebra*.
