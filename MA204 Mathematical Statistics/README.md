I took this  course in Spring 2026, after taking Probability Theory, which is a must-learn course for class 2027 in the Math Department, in Fall 2025. Thses two courses are the most important courses for students majoring Statistics, also providing useful tools/theories for machine learning, etc.

Mathematical Statistics is a subjest lying on Probability Theory. Its basis is the philosophy statistians had been building for over 100 years.

The course's core part covers basic knowledge for you to conduct a test to judge whether a hypothesis is reliable enough and to find the (uniformly) most powerful test.

'Learning is a painful process.' It's not lieing. Although the theory itself and thoughts, or say philosophy, behind it are both intriguing, the long learning hours are composed mostly of boring homework and calculation.

I had to admit that, in this course, homework plays a crutial role as it provides many complements to the main texts. Doing homework gets you to some circumstances that not exist in the reading part. So pay attention to it.
