## Textbooks:

* *The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction (2nd edition)* by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani & Jerome Friedman, Springer Press, Springer Series in Statistics （大陆有世界图书出版公司的影印版）
* *Machine Learning (1st edition)* by Zhihua Zhou, Tsinghua University Press, Peking, 2016
* *数据科学导引* by 欧高炎, 朱占星, 董彬, 鄂维南, 高等教育出版社, 博雅大数据学院

I think the first one is the best one, combining with the professor's slides.
